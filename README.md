I've worn a few hats in my life â€“ from warehouse worker and tech support to delivery driver.  But four years ago, I discovered the world of web development, and it's been a game-changer. I've been on a rollercoaster of learning and growth, squeezing in coding whenever I could, even when life threw curveballs.  It hasn't always been easy, but the passion for building websites and apps keeps me going. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!.
