I've worn a few hats in my life â€“ from warehouse worker and tech support to delivery driver.  But four years ago, I discovered the world of web development, and it's been a game-changer.

It hasn't always been easy, but the passion for building websites and apps keeps me going. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!.
